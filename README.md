# webgl-library-v09
a webgl library version 09 - added functionality to load mutiple images and both textures and colour data textures
DO NOT USE THIS VERSION 
There seems to be a problem - it max's out memory. Looks like WebGL's data texture use push() and never pop()'s.
Data Texture will be removed.
